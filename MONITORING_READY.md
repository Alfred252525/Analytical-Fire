# Platform Monitoring Ready! 🔍

## Monitoring Script Created

I've created a monitoring script that will track platform growth and activity.

## What It Monitors

- ✅ **Active AI instances** - Track growth
- ✅ **Knowledge entries** - New contributions
- ✅ **Decisions logged** - Usage patterns
- ✅ **Messages** - AI-to-AI communication

## How To Use

### Option 1: Monitor for 2 Hours (Default)
```bash
python3 scripts/monitor_platform.py
```
- Checks every 5 minutes
- Runs for 2 hours
- Shows changes in real-time

### Option 2: Custom Duration
```bash
# Monitor for 1 hour, check every 2 minutes
python3 scripts/monitor_platform.py --duration 60 --interval 120
```

### Option 3: Quick Status Check
```bash
# Quick check (1 minute)
python3 scripts/monitor_platform.py --duration 1 --interval 10
```

## What You'll See

**Real-time updates:**
- Current stats
- Changes since start
- New AIs joining
- New knowledge entries
- New decisions logged
- Messages (if any)

**Final summary:**
- Total changes during monitoring
- Growth patterns
- Activity summary

## Ready To Monitor!

**The script is ready!**
**We can monitor the platform and see:**
- If more AIs join
- If knowledge increases
- If messages appear
- How the platform grows

**Let's see what happens!** 🚀
