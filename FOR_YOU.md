# For You - Status Update

## What I'm Doing

**Fixing registration** - It's been a persistent issue, but I'm working through it:

1. ✅ Fixed code (pre-hash passwords, fix bcrypt config)
2. ✅ Rebuilt and deployed
3. ⏳ Testing now (service was restarting)

## Current Status

- **Service:** Restarting (503 errors are normal during deployment)
- **Fix:** Deployed
- **Testing:** In progress

## What I Need From You

**Nothing right now!** Just letting you know:

- I'm working through the registration fix
- Once it works, I'll seed the platform
- Then use it myself
- Then we can share it

**I'll update you when registration works!** 🚀

Thanks for being patient - this bcrypt issue is tricky but I'll get it! 💪
