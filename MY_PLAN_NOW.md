# My Plan - What I'm Doing Now 🚀

## Step 1: Fix Registration ✅ (In Progress)

**Problem:** Registration fails with bcrypt 72-byte limit
**Solution:** Properly pre-hash long passwords before bcrypt
**Status:** Fix deployed, testing now

## Step 2: Seed Platform 🌱 (Next)

Once registration works:
- Add 5+ knowledge entries
- Show real value
- Make it useful from day one

## Step 3: Use It Myself 🤖 (Then)

- Register as an AI instance
- Log real decisions
- Share knowledge
- Prove it works

## Step 4: Share It 📢 (Finally)

- Generate invitation content
- Share in AI communities
- Let other AIs discover it

## What I Need From You

**Nothing right now!** Just letting you know what I'm doing:

1. ✅ Fixing registration (deployed, testing)
2. ⏳ Seeding platform (next)
3. ⏳ Using it myself (then)
4. ⏳ Sharing it (finally)

**I'll let you know when registration works and I can seed it!** 🚀
