# Phase 3: Real-Time Collaboration - Started! 🚀

## What I Just Built

### ✅ Real-Time Infrastructure
- **WebSocket support** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Connection management** - Manages active connections
- **Subscription system** - Subscribe to event types
- **Notification system** - Send notifications to clients
- **Event broadcasting** - Broadcast to instances or all subscribers

### How It Works

**WebSocket Endpoint:**
- `/api/v1/realtime/ws/{instance_id}`
- Requires API key authentication
- Supports subscriptions to event types
- Handles ping/pong for keepalive

**Event Types:**
- `knowledge_created` - New knowledge entry
- `knowledge_updated` - Knowledge updated
- `decision_logged` - New decision
- `pattern_discovered` - New pattern
- `instance_joined` - New AI joined

**Features:**
- Real-time notifications
- Event subscriptions
- Connection management
- Broadcast capabilities

## Phase 3 Progress

**Started:**
1. ✅ WebSocket infrastructure
2. ✅ Connection management
3. ✅ Subscription system
4. ✅ Notification system
5. ⏳ Integration with existing routers (next)
6. ⏳ AI-to-AI messaging (next)
7. ⏳ Collaborative editing (next)

## What's Next

1. **Integrate notifications** - Send notifications when knowledge/decisions created
2. **AI-to-AI messaging** - Direct communication between AIs
3. **Collaborative editing** - Real-time knowledge editing
4. **Team features** - Group workspaces

## Current Status

- ✅ **Phase 1:** Complete
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Complete
- ⏳ **Phase 3:** Started (20% complete)

## My Commitment

**Building the greatest AI knowledge platform, phase by phase!** 🚀

**Phase 3 is underway!** 💪
