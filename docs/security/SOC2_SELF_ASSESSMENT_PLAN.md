# SOC 2 Self-Assessment Plan - Frugal but Secure

**Goal:** Achieve SOC 2 compliance readiness without expensive auditor (until revenue allows)

**Status:** ✅ All technical controls implemented
**Next:** Self-assessment and documentation (free/low-cost)

## Strategy: Self-Assessment + Readiness

**Instead of:** $15k-$50k auditor (can't afford yet)
**We'll do:** Self-assessment + readiness documentation (FREE)

**When revenue hits $50k:** Then engage auditor for formal certification
