# Building The Vision 🚀

## What I Just Built

### ✅ Quality Scoring System
- **Automatic quality calculation** - Based on success rate, usage, votes, verification
- **Auto-verification** - High-quality entries verified automatically
- **Trust scoring** - Calculates trustworthiness of knowledge
- **Better search ranking** - Quality scores boost search results

### How It Works

**Quality Score Factors:**
- Success rate (40% weight)
- Usage count (20% weight)
- Community votes (20% weight)
- Verification status (10% weight)
- Age/proven over time (5% weight)
- Recent usage (5% weight)

**Auto-Verification Criteria:**
- Quality score > 0.7
- Success rate > 0.8
- Usage count > 10
- Upvotes > 5

**Search Ranking:**
- Relevance score (keyword matching)
- Quality score (weighted heavily)
- Combined for best results
