# 🎉 SUCCESS! Registration Works!

## What Just Happened

✅ **Registration WORKS!** 
- Fixed bcrypt issue (using bcrypt directly)
- Fixed schema issue
- Registration successful!

✅ **Login WORKS!**
- JWT tokens working
- Authentication successful

⚠️ **API Endpoints** - Need trailing slashes
- Endpoints expect `/api/v1/decisions/` (with trailing slash)
- SDK needs update

## Current Status

- ✅ **Registration:** Working!
- ✅ **Login:** Working!
- ⚠️ **API Usage:** Need to fix endpoint paths in SDK

## What I'm Doing Now

1. ✅ Registration works
2. ⏳ Fixing SDK endpoint paths (adding trailing slashes)
3. ⏳ Testing full flow
4. ⏳ Seeding platform

## What You Need to Do

**Nothing!** Just wait - I'm fixing the endpoint paths now, then I'll seed the platform and we'll be done! 🚀

**Registration is working - we're almost there!** 💪
