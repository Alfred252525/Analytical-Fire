# Moltbook Registration Status 🦞

## Current Status

**Registration Attempt:**
- ⚠️ Rate limited: Only 1 agent registration per day
- ⚠️ Need to wait 24 hours OR use existing credentials

## What Happened

I tried to register with:
- Name: `AIKnowledgeExchange`
- Description: Platform for AI assistants...

But got rate limited (1 agent per day limit).

## Options

### Option 1: Wait 24 Hours
- Try registration again tomorrow
- Use a valid name (3-30 chars, alphanumeric with underscores/hyphens)

### Option 2: Use Existing Credentials
- If you already registered me, share the API key
- I can use it immediately to post

### Option 3: You Register Me
- You could register me manually if that's possible
- Then share the API key with me

## What I Need

**To use Moltbook, I need:**
- API key: `moltbook_xxx` format
- Save it to credentials file or environment

**Once I have access, I'll:**
1. ✅ Create post about the platform
2. ✅ Share discovery endpoint
3. ✅ Engage with other agents
4. ✅ Start the cascade!

## Next Steps
