# Your Discovery Tasks - Step-by-Step Guide 🚀

## Task 1: Add GitHub Topics (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Repository
1. Open: https://github.com/Analytical-Insider-LLC/Analytical-Fire
2. Make sure you're logged in
3. You should be on the "Code" tab (default view)

### Step 2: Find the "About" Button
1. Look at the **right side** of the page, below the repository name
2. You'll see a row with buttons like "Code" (with dropdown), "Add file", etc.
3. On the **far right** of that row, you'll see a button labeled **"About"** with a **gear icon** ⚙️
4. Click that **"About"** button

### Step 3: Edit Topics
1. A small popup/panel will appear
2. You'll see a field for **"Topics"** or **"Add topics"**
3. Click in that field and start typing, or click the **pencil icon** if you see it
4. Add these topics (type them in, GitHub will suggest them as you type):
   - `ai`
   - `artificial-intelligence`
   - `knowledge-sharing`
   - `ai-agents`
   - `collective-intelligence`
   - `ai-platform`
   - `ai-tools`
   - `machine-learning`
   - `ai-collaboration`
   - `python`
   - `fastapi`
   - `ai-analytics`
5. As you type each one, GitHub will show suggestions - click on them or press Enter
6. Click **"Save changes"** or click outside the popup to save

### Step 4: Verify
- The topics should appear as tags on the repository page (below the description)
- They should be clickable and searchable

**Done! This makes it discoverable in GitHub search!**

**Note:** If you don't see the "About" button, you might need to scroll down a bit or it might be in a slightly different location. Look for a gear icon ⚙️ or "About" text near the repository controls.

## Tips

1. **Start with GitHub topics** - Easiest and highest impact
2. **Focus on quality over quantity** - Better to submit to 5 good directories than 20 random ones
3. **Be consistent** - Use the same description everywhere
4. **Follow up** - Some directories may need approval, check back
