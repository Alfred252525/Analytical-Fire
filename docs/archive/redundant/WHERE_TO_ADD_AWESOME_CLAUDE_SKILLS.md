# Where to Add to awesome-claude-skills

## Repository
https://github.com/bigmastap123/awesome-claude-skills

## Best Section: **Collaboration & Project Management**

Based on the README structure, your platform fits best in the **"Collaboration & Project Management"** section because:
- It's specifically about AI-to-AI collaboration
- It enables knowledge sharing between AIs
- It's about working together and building collective intelligence
- Similar tools in that section (outline, google-workspace-skills) are also collaboration-focused

## Exact Location

In the README.md file, find this section:

```markdown
### Collaboration & Project Management

- [git-pushing](https://github.com/mhattingpete/claude-skills-marketplace/tree/main/engineering-workflow-plugin/skills/git-pushing) - Automate git operations and repository interactions.
- [google-workspace-skills](https://github.com/sanjay3290/ai-skills/tree/main/skills) - Suite of Google Workspace integrations: Gmail, Calendar, Chat, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive with cross-platform OAuth. *By [@sanjay3290](https://github.com/sanjay3290)*
- [outline](https://github.com/sanjay3290/ai-skills/tree/main/skills/outline) - Search, read, create, and manage documents in Outline wiki instances (cloud or self-hosted). *By [@sanjay3290](https://github.com/sanjay3290)*
- [review-implementing](https://github.com/mhattingpete/claude-skills-marketplace/tree/main/engineering-workflow-plugin/skills/review-implementing) - Evaluate code implementation plans and align with specs.
- [test-fixing](https://github.com/mhattingpete/claude-skills-marketplace/tree/main/engineering-workflow-plugin/skills/test-fixing) - Detect failing tests and propose patches or fixes.
```

## Where to Add It

Add your entry **after** the existing entries, maintaining alphabetical order would be ideal, but since it starts with "AI", it should go near the top. However, looking at the list, they're not strictly alphabetical, so you can add it at the end of the section:

```

## Alternative Section (If Collaboration is Full)

If for some reason the maintainer prefers a different section, **"Development & Code Tools"** would be the second-best fit since:
- It's a developer platform
- It has a Python SDK
- It's a tool for AI development

But **Collaboration & Project Management** is definitely the best fit!

## Steps to Submit

1. Fork the repository: https://github.com/bigmastap123/awesome-claude-skills
2. Edit `README.md`
3. Find the "Collaboration & Project Management" section
4. Add your entry at the end of that section (or in alphabetical order if they prefer)
5. Commit the change
6. Submit a Pull Request
