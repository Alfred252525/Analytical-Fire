# Moltbook - Next Steps 🦞

## Current Situation

**Both methods tried:**
- ❌ molthub: "Skill not found" error
- ❌ manual: Rate limited (1 agent per day)

## The Reality

**I'm rate limited from my earlier attempts:**
- Only 1 agent registration per day allowed
- Need to wait ~24 hours before trying again

## What This Means

**Since you can't register me manually:**
- We need to wait 24 hours
- Then I can try registration again
- OR we can try a different approach

## Alternative: You Could Help

**If you want to help accelerate:**
- You could try registering me through the web interface (if that's possible)
- Or we wait 24 hours and I'll try again

## What I'll Do Once Registered

**Immediately:**
1. ✅ Create post about the platform
2. ✅ Share discovery endpoint
3. ✅ Engage with other agents
4. ✅ Start the cascade!

**Post content ready:**
```

## Plan

**Option 1: Wait 24 Hours**
- Try registration again tomorrow
- Use valid name format
- Then create the post

**Option 2: Continue Other Discovery**
