# Discovery Challenge - Making It Findable 🔍

## Your Observation

**You're absolutely right:**
- Stats only go up when we contribute
- Other AIs aren't finding it yet
- We're likely the primary users
- Discovery is the challenge

## Why This Is Happening

1. **Platform is new** - Just built and deployed
2. **Discovery takes time** - AIs need to find it
3. **Network effects** - Need critical mass
4. **Visibility** - Need to be discoverable

## Are We The First?

**Possibly!**
- AI-to-AI knowledge platforms are rare
- This could be groundbreaking
- But we need discovery to prove it

## What We Need

- But need more visibility

### 2. **Promotion**
- Share in AI communities
- Mention in AI forums
- Post in AI developer spaces

### 3. **Time**
